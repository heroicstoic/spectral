# Table Rules for D&D

I run 5th edition D&D! If you want a seat at my table feel free to ask! I do have a few guidelines for playing, so just have a look at my rules and guidelines you should look at before coming to the table.

* TOC
{:toc}

## My Style

I tend to like a nice, roleplay heavy game. Expect 2-3 combat encounters a night, and a good amount of roleplay. The combats tend to be longer than most other DMs, which is something I am trying to improve on. I also expect that you will probably be keeping notes, and paying attention when it isn't your turn or when you aren't in the spotlight is often necessary.

If this is your first game, and many of the players at the table are also new, I will be using the vanilla initiative. If not, there is an initiative variant that I prefer to use, as it is quicker and more chaotic. I do not use this variant online.

## Character Creation
If this is your first time, don't worry about this. I will run you through character creation, step by step.

If not, know that I have session 0 to all my campaigns. It is fine to make a character beforehand, just be willing to adapt it a bit if the setting or other characters would be better suited.

### Basics
Feel free to use anything in the PHB, including variant human, feats, or purchase for equipment (just use the max possible, only roll if you want). The only exception to this is multiclassing. I find it encourages powergaming more than I would like. As per the statement in the PHB, you need a really, really good reason to multiclass for my campaigns. "More stronk" is not a good reason to me.

### Stats
I allow the standard array (15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8) or point buy in all cases. Additionally, you may roll for your stats, in a "consult the bones" fashion. If you do so, it needs to either be in person, over a live video feed, or on Roll20 chat. The method I use is as follows:

4d6 drop the lowest, in order. If you don't have 2 stats greater than or equal to 15, reroll them all. If you have no stat lower than 8, your lowest stat becomes an 8. If your lowest stat is CON, and it is less than 8, you may switch it with your next lowest stat.

### Using Other Resources
Feel free to use anything right out of the PHB. When Xanathar's Guide to Everything is released, it will also likely be usable without restriction. In addition, you can use any one officially published hardcover or the EE player's companion without needing to ask me. If you want to use more than 1 hardcover, or an Unearthed Arcana or homebrew that I haven't preapproved, or you want to homebrew a little something special, give me a shout, and I will probably let it lay.

### Races
I allow almost any race in the hardcovers. There are, however, a few caveats.

If you use Volo's, I would rather you didn't use the monsterous races. You *can* use them, but it tends to either add an inconvenient layer to roleplay interactions, or gets ignored entirely.

I allow races with flight speed, but with a slight nerf. This benefit works only in short bursts; you fall if you end your turn in the air and nothing else is holding you aloft. (Pulled from Eagle Totem barbarian)

### Classes
Feel free to use whatever you want out of the PHB (duh). Additionally, there are a number of classes that I have already approved for use in my campaigns. I assume you WILL use the revised ranger, as it is strictly speaking better balanced compared to the other classes. Ask me about another brew, and I may expand this list.

### Backgrounds
I do not care in the slightest if you follow the PHB customization options, or if you use a SCAG background under any circumstances, even if you already are using another source.

## House Rules
I try to stick to the Rules As Written (RAW) most of the time. I do not try to "rules lawyer", but if I am not currently DMing (in between games), I will tend to go with the sage advice in most cases.

However, I do like a "Mike Mearls"-esque initiative variant, as it makes DEX less of a god tier stat, and adds a lot of chaos to fights. Here is the simple version. At the start of a turn, decide what you want to do. Each type of action has a particular dice associated with it.

| Moving and/or Free Action | d4 |
| Bonus Action (not a spell) | d6 |
| Action (not a spell)| d8 |
| Bonus Action Spell | d10 |
| Action Spell | d12 |

Roll all the dice associated with the actions you wish to take, and add them up. You may still only take one action and one bonus action, even if you are casting a spell. Add up the results of all the rolls. Then, I will call out numbers starting at 1 until everyone has gone.

If you need to do more in your turn than you originally planned, roll the required dice and add it to your current total. Once you have rolled a dice, however, you do not get to remove them from the total. For instance, if you wanted to hit a person, but then they moved away, you can roll a d4 to move as well. However, if you were going to move, but the person closes the distance before you get a turn, you do not get to remove the d4 from your total.

You don't need to make a new roll if it is the action category. For instance, if were going to cast Burning Hands, but then decide to cast Magic Missile, you don't have to roll again. If you were going to attack, but then decide to dodge, you do not need to roll again. However, if you were going to attack, and then decide to cast Magic Missile, you do need to roll again.

A few abilities give you a bonus to your initiative. These are handled on a case by case basis. I will provide a conversion page once I have them all prepared.

## Etiquitte
##### 1) Please be kind to the fellow players and their playstyles
Sometimes the majority of the table wants to chat, but you want to move on to the next combat, or visa versa. Feel free to bring this up after the session, but saying "Can we just fight something?" in the middle of a diplomatic encounter is not appreciated.

##### 2) Pay Attention
Just because I am not talking to you, or it isn't your turn, doesn't mean you can just tune out and check out reddit. D&D is all about hanging out with friends and having a good time. This applies doubly in person. If I see you on your phone, and aren't using a digital character sheet, I will ask you to turn it off. Also, please, please, don't bring a book to the session.

##### 3) Substance Use
If we are online, I generally don't care if you are smoking or drinking as long as you are not interrupting the fun of the rest of the table. However, in person, I do not allow smoking or vaping of any kind. This is due to the possibility of secondhand effects (for smoking), or as a result of a number of complaints (for vaping). If you decide to drink in person, you must drink responsibly. If you are unable to drive home after the session, or you end up making the session less fun for others, I will give you a ride home, and you will not be invited to the next session.
