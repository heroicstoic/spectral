# Hey guys

I have a few excepts from the PHB that may make your lives easier.

First, your race information. This will have what abilities you get from your races in particular. There is also a link to the spells you get as a Tiefling, Sean.

Spell descriptions for [Thaumaturgy](https://5thsrd.org/spellcasting/spells/thaumaturgy/), [Hellish Rebuke](https://5thsrd.org/spellcasting/spells/hellish_rebuke/), and [Darkness](https://5thsrd.org/spellcasting/spells/darkness/)

Ok, now for class information. I know that Sean didn't know about battlemaster, as I failed to mention it, so I've included the full class descriptions for the full fighter class. Javy, there is also a link to my personal home rules for way of the 4 elements monk, so we will be using that instead of what is in the book.

Now, for the full background information. I have just taken the whole section on this from the PHB, so here it is for you to use.

And last, and probably least, I have the item lists for you to look at. This will have both the items you can usually purchase and the trinkets that we roll for. You can pick one at random or have a random number generator make a number between 1 and 100 to pick one for you.

Oh, and if you need it, here is a link to the character sheet I like to use. Enjoy.
