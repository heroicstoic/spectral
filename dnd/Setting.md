# The Great Link

This is the short version of my custom campaign setting and some of its variations from the standard 5e "Forgotten Realms" setting. Not all of my campaigns occur in the Great Link, but many will. Name is a work in progress.

## Basic Features

The Great Link is inside of a torus. When you gaze skyward, you see the continents and cities of other lands. Often, these cities will communicate through signal fires, making much of the world very well connected, even through non-magical means.

Direct sunlight does not last very long, but due to the albedo of the oceans and landmasses, days are about the same length as Earth. Dawn and dusk are significantly longer, and nights are darker due to the lack of a moon equivalent. This drives cities to light themselves very well, and allows the monsters of the night an easier time finding their marks.

### Nibala

The main continent we work in is called Nibala. It is situated in a very favorable position for transimitting messages around the link, as it is situated between two powerful inner continents that would otherwise be unable to communicate. 

It is in the middle of a large stretch of ocean, but has a number of biomes and natural resources to support a diverse population. Due to its importance as a communication hub, it has also grown into a fair trade hub, able to easily bring in any resources it cannot otherwise acquired. If Nibala falls under hard times, many nations will respond to come to its aid. However, its value also makes it a frequent target for those seeking to expand their empires. Thus far, it has stood strong against the tides of battle.

### Thelb

While there are very large cities on the coast of Nibala, the largest, most diverse, and most politically important city is Thelb, the central city. This city is the largest communication hub in the Great Link, by measure of both signals and magical means, and is a close contender for traditional postage. All of the major civilizations on Nibala have roads leading to Thelb, where they mix into one. While it isn't the most peaceful of cities, it serves as a fair melting pot. Adventurers, merchants, politicians and common folk alike are drawn to the alure of the oppurtunities in Thelb. It is the place to go to learn of happenings all around the Link, and is an easy springboard for those eager to start a new life.

## Magic

Magic is a very common and well known force in the world. It is generally well accepted, barring a few notable cases, and is seen mostly as a useful tool.

### Arcane
The arcane is by far the most well understood of the magics. Many will study its effects for the simple practical application, even if they do not become wizards. As such, many of those who can afford a full formal education may be able to cast the occasional cantrip, despite not being a full magic user.

### Nature

Nature magic is typically seen as a magic more shrouded in mysticism, often harder to control and more useful for those outside the civilized world. While rangers of the wilds may use it for good, there is a sense that the natural magics might influence those who dip too deeply, and lead them to sow chaos and destruction when fully embraced.

### Divine

Those in the Great Link do not tend draw on powerful beings for their divine magics. While some worship powerful entities that grant this magic, the most common religion of the Nibala region is that of the Church of Faithful Callings. The faithful choose a task or goal, called a Calling, which they spend their lives trying to fulfill. It is believed that those with similar callings are linked together by a common grand soul, and this grants them their magic. The more resiliant their soul is, the greater the connection to those similarly compelled, and the more powerful their magics become.

## Race Variations

While most races functions similarly to their written counterparts, there are a few variations to keep in mind while building your character. In general, races that are seen as non-monsterous but dangerous in the Forgotten Realms are hesitantly accepted into society.

### Drow

There are actually surface Drow, often living in isolation either underground or in regions with thick canopy or cloud cover. These are not terribly common, and you will still be seen as a strange outlander in most cases, but they are more just frightening slavers to the average person. However, those of the Dark Link (the Great Link's Underdark) are still viewed with contempt.

### Tieflings

Tieflings are not seen as monstrosities or creatures to be feared. More often than not, they are seen as tragic accidents. While you will get stares and seldom feel accepted, people will not assume you are evil due to your appearance. However, the feral are not granted such amnesty unless they are re-educated into a social hierarchy.

### Aasimar

Due to the lack of celestial worship, you need to hide your identity less than you might otherwise think. In fact, some will see you as odd accidents that might just best be avoided. If you decide to use your powers in public, expect a response from fear instead of awe in many instances, as it is not unheard of for Aasimar to try and seize power and control others.
