## Welcome to my temporary webpage 

This site will containt my D&D table rules, Personal Projects, and more, in time.
This website is still under construction. Please understand if there is missing content.

</div>

<div class-"major">
[D&D Table Rules](TableRules.md)

[Quick Link to Character Class Options](pdf/CharOpts.pdf). This will be expanded over time.

[My Campaign Setting (WIP)](Setting.md)

[OI! Sean and Javy! Click here for some relevant sheets!](Tuesday.md)

I run 5th edition D&D.

[Click here for the 5e PHB](https://dnd.rem.uz/5e%20D%26D%20Books/Rulebooks/Core/Player%27s%20Handbook.pdf).

This is a massive file, so you need to be patient. Open it once, and download for future use. If you want to buy it [Amazon has some pretty good deals](https://www.amazon.com/Players-Handbook-Dungeons-Dragons-Wizards/dp/0786965606), but don't feel obligated in the slightest.

This is an attempt to force a website rebuild, please ignore...
